## 👋 Hi, I'm Tetiana Sukhorska

# Junior Fullstack Developer 

 I focus on creating effective REST APIs and optimising performance. I am purposefully studying React to close the development cycle and transition to a full-stack position. I adhere to clean coding principles, am confident working with Git, and am ready for team collaboration in an Agile/Scrum environment.

## 💻Featured Projects
- [Products-card](https://github.com/Tatyana-S3/Products-card) - a custom project covering the entire data interaction cycle.

  The project includes:
1. Dynamic loading and display of product cards (via API).
2. Functionality for adding/removing products to the Basket and Favourites.
3. User state storage using LocalStorage.

- [DreamTeam](https://github.com/Tatyana-S3/DreamTeam) - a team project for a furniture web shop, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, compiled via Vite. The project uses the Swiper, Axios, iziToast, and accordion-js libraries. The interface is responsive: the site displays correctly on desktops and mobile devices — menus, sliders, and product cards adjust to the screen size. REST API is used to interact with the server: the application sends and receives data about products, categories, and orders via HTTP requests implemented through Axios.
- [project-group-05](https://github.com/Tatyana-S3/project-group-05) - adaptive landing page for "YogaBloom" yoga studio, developed by a team with a focus on clean code, semantic HTML markup, and responsive design. Implemented using HTML5, CSS3, and native JavaScript in accordance with team development principles.
